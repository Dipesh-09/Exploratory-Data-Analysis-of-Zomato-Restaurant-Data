# Exploratory Data Analysis of Zomato Restaurant Data

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Zomato restaurant data! In this project, I used Python, SQLite and various data analysis libraries to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about restaurants in Bangalore, India, from the Zomato platform.

## Project Overview

This project aims to uncover insights from the Zomato restaurant dataset through a series of data analysis steps, visualization techniques, and geographical analysis. By combining Python programming and data science methodologies, the project provides valuable insights for restaurant owners, entrepreneurs, and data enthusiasts.

## Python Libraries Used

- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Numerical operations and array computations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting.
- Geopy: Geographical coordinates extraction.
- Folium: Interactive map creation.
##### SQLite: Database management and data retrieval.

## Steps Involved in Analysis

1. **Data Inspection and Cleaning**: Handled missing values in key columns while preserving data integrity.
2. **Rating and Online Ordering Analysis**: Explored the relationship between restaurant ratings and online ordering availability.
3. **Customer Review Analysis**: Processed and analyzed customer reviews to extract insights and sentiments.
4. **Geographical Insights**: Extracted geographical coordinates and visualized restaurant concentrations on interactive heatmaps.

## Key Insights

- Restaurants with higher ratings often offer online ordering services, suggesting a correlation between convenience and customer satisfaction.
- Customer review analysis provided insights into popular dishes, customer sentiments, and preferences.
- Geographical heatmaps highlighted hotspot areas for specific cuisines, aiding potential restaurateurs in location decisions.
